Place cabbage in an extra large bowl or pot. Combine salt with 2 cups of lukewarm water, stir to dissolve salt. Pour salt water over the cabbage and add remaining 4 cups, stir to mix. If you can, place a plate or circular baking dish of sorts on top to submerge the cabbage (I used a pie dish), place something with a good amount of weight on top to hold down if necessary (it’s not completely necessary but will help to evenly wilt the cabbage). Give cabbage a good mix every now and then. Let soak for 2 hours, up to 12 if you like. I found that 2 – 4 hours was enough and didn’t see much change between the two times.\\nMake your seasonings: While cabbage is soaking, combine apple, onion, ginger and garlic in food processor/blender and process until fairly smooth.\\nIn a small bowl, mix the chili pepper with a small amount of water to make a wet paste. You can just as easily blend it with the apple/onion mixture adding a couple tablespoons of water as well.\\nMix everything together: Once cabbage is ready, drain water, reserving 1/2 cup, and rinse well. Place cabbage back in large bowl, combine with the scallions, apple/onion mixture and chili paste. Mix well to coat all pieces. Either use your hands (with gloves on pref to protect from the chili pepper) or simply use wooden spoons to toss everything.\\nPacking: Place the kimchi in glass jars or containers with lid, pack down the best you can to close air pockets and leave about an inch at the top for air and gases. Top with remaining juices, add reserved brine if needed to cover vegetables.\\nFermenting: Let kimchi sit at room temp (or in a cool place like a pantry or closet if weather is extremely warm) for 24 – 36 hours. After 24 hours, open kimchi and pack the mixture down with a spoon (the cabbage will have likely shrunk and you’ll have more liquids). You may notice it bubbling, this is perfectly normal as the kimchi is fermenting. As your kimchi ferments the flavors will develop, taste every 24 hours and place kimchi in the refrigerator once you’re happy with the taste and to slow fermentation, usually after 36 – 48 hours. It should be tangy, spicy and slightly sweet. After moving to the fridge, it’s best used within a month, maybe two.\\nMakes about 3 – 4 cups\\nServe with rice, use in Kimchi Fried Rice or make Kimchi Tofu Scramble!', metadata={'row': 1369.0, 'source': './recipes.csv'}),\n",

      "assistant: Winston lives in an apartment building called Victory Mansions. Upon entering Victory Mansions, Winston is faced with a gritty dust swirl carried in by a vile wind. The hallways of the building have an unpleasant smell of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. The lift often does not work and there were no attempts to fix it during the time of power cuts to prepare for Hate Week, so Winston has to use the stairs to reach his flat, which is seven flights up. The flat itself has a telescreen that cannot be completely turned off, which serves not only as a source of propaganda but also as a monitoring device to observe and listen to the inhabitants continuously. Winston's physical appearance is also described; he is a frail figure with fair hair, roughened skin, and he wears the blue overalls that is the uniform of the party.\n",
      "\n",
      "The apartment and its surroundings reflect the bleakness and decay of the world Orwell depicts in \"1984,\" with constant surveillance by Big Brother, posters with party slogans plastered everywhere, and government buildings that loom over the desolate landscape. There's a sense of grim functionality to Winston's living space, combined with a lack of privacy due to the omnipresent telescreen. The decrepit state of the surroundings and the intrusion of the Party into personal spaces are central to the setting and tone of the novel.\n",
      "user:  Where does he work?\n",
      "assistant: Winston works at the Ministry of Truth, which is referred to as \"Minitrue\" in Newspeak. The Ministry of Truth is an enormous pyramidal structure that is 300 meters tall, made of glittering white concrete, and stands out significantly amidst the surrounding architecture. Its primary concerns are with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ministry is one of four such large government buildings in London, each housing a different ministry responsible for different aspects of the government's operations. These include the Ministry of Peace (dealing with war), the Ministry of Love (maintaining law and order), and the Ministry of Plenty (responsible for economic affairs), in addition to the Ministry of Truth where Winston works. Each of these buildings dwarfs the surrounding structures and brings home the omnipresence of the Party and its control over every facet of life in Oceania.\n"
